This add-on allows you to select vertices based on their position relative to the world axes. For example, you can easily select all vertices on the positive X side of the scene.

Additionally, it includes a feature to select vertices near the axis center within a customizable threshold, providing more precise control over your selections.

As a bonus, it also addresses the limitations of Blender's built-in symmetry snap. This custom solution, while slightly slower, offers more accurate snapping by matching a selected vertex to its exact opposite based on a defined threshold, ensuring perfect symmetry in your models.

You can access the add-on from the Tool menu in the right-side panel.
